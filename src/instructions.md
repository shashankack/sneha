A Brief Description of Your Proposed Solution:

The Porsche 3-click test drive booking system is enhanced with AI concierge, AR/VR previews, haptics for EV experiences, and post-test-drive follow-ups. The goal is to reduce booking friction, make it easier for busy wealthy people to book a test drive, attract new customers with the existing loyal customers, filter genuine customers, improve conversion after the test drive, and give luxury personalized experiences to the customers while booking online in the same way as offline, with emotional and unique experiences and attractions.

Step 1- The AI voice assistant asks some questions for the customers and suggests a model for them based on their answers and also gives them the option to select their own interested model.

Step 2- Shows and selects the nearest center, available date, and time (Select Concierge service (Porsche delivered to your location), which is available for a refundable deposit, which can be redeemed when buying the car).

Step 3- Porsche ID verification + Payment if they have selected concierge service; if not, then that will be free of cost when they choose to come to the Porsche center, and the booking is instantly confirmed to the dealer via the central Booking Orchestrator.
For customers who select the Concierge Service , integrate the central Booking Orchestrator with the My Porsche App  to provide real-time, high-precision tracking of the delivery driver (similar to high-end delivery services)


Following steps: Immediately after booking, the system issues a premium Wallet pass and also an email. Provide an optional AR/VR micro-preview and engine-haptics experience to build anticipation and to see the Porsche in their driveway or garage before even test driving. 
For high-intent EV/Hybrid Explorers, the Haptics experience should simulate more than just engine sound. It should simulate the instant torque of the Taycan or the unique, silent soundscape of the all-electric driving experience, directly addressing the "fear of missing out" on performance. The customer should be able to select from different Drive Mode Haptics (e.g., Comfort vs. Sport Plus) to communicate the duality of the Porsche driving experience.
Then customers can also pick a theme or route to go on a test drive. Provides the option of 'connect your music' while test driving.
Introduce a Post-Drive 'Moment of Reflection' Protocol : The Concierge team (Dealer Network)  is trained on a specific follow-up protocol. Within two hours of the test drive conclusion, send a personalized, non-sales email where the email should contain 1-2 curated photos taken by the Concierge during the drive (e.g., the car in the customer's driveway), along with a link to a digital summary of the key features discussed.









Instructions for Building the Porsche 3-Click Test Drive Website
Objective
Create a single-page React application for a luxurious 3-click Porsche test drive booking experience. The application will be a frontend-only prototype using dummy data.

Core Technologies
Framework: React.js (using Vite for setup)

UI Library: Material-UI (MUI)

Animation Library: Framer Motion

State Management: React Context API

Phase 1: Project Setup & Theming
Initialize Project:

Create a new React project using Vite: npm create vite@latest porsche-booking-app -- --template react.

Navigate into the project directory.

Install Dependencies:

Install MUI: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

Install MUI Date Pickers: npm install @mui/x-date-pickers

Install Framer Motion: npm install framer-motion

Create Folder Structure:

Inside the src folder, create the following directories:

assets/: For images.

components/: For individual, reusable components (e.g., Header.jsx, Footer.jsx).

pages/: For the main application views (LandingPage.jsx, etc.).

contexts/: For the state management context.

data/: For dummy data files.

theme/: For the MUI theme configuration.

Configure MUI Theme:

Create a file at src/theme/theme.js.

Define a theme using createTheme from MUI.

Use the following color palette:

primary.main: #000000 (BLACK)

secondary.main: #CC0000 (PORSCHE RED) - This will be used for CTAs.

background.default: #FFFFFF (WHITE)

text.primary: #000000 (BLACK)

text.secondary: #808080 (MEDIUM GRAY)

Configure typography to use a modern, clean font like "Inter" or "Roboto".

Wrap the main <App> component in src/main.jsx with <ThemeProvider theme={theme}> and <CssBaseline />.

Phase 2: Dummy Data Creation
Models Data:

Create src/data/models.js.

Export a JavaScript array of car objects. Each object should have id, name, title (e.g., "The All-Electric Performer"), description, and image (URL to a high-res image). Include at least 3 models (e.g., Taycan, 911, Cayenne).

Centers Data:

Create src/data/centers.js.

Export an array of Porsche Center objects, each with id, name, and address.

AI Conversation Data:

Create src/data/aiConversation.js.

Export a simple scripted conversation flow. This can be an array of objects, each with a type (question or recommendation) and text. The final object should link to a model id from models.js.

Phase 3: State Management
Create Booking Context:

Create src/contexts/BookingContext.jsx.

Use the createContext and useState hooks.

The context provider should manage a state object that includes:

step: The current step in the booking process (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

selectedModel: The Porsche model object chosen by the user.

bookingType: 'center' or 'concierge'.

selectedCenter: The ID of the chosen Porsche Center.

bookingDetails: An object with address, date, time.

The provider must also expose functions to update this state (e.g., handleSelectModel, setStep, etc.).

Phase 4: Page & Component Implementation
General Rule: All pages should be responsive. Use MUI's Grid and Stack components for layout. Animate page transitions using framer-motion.

App.jsx:

This component will act as a router.

It should read the step from the BookingContext.

Use conditional rendering to display the correct page component based on the current step.

pages/LandingPage.jsx (Step 0):

Hero Section: A full-viewport component with a high-quality Porsche background image.

Headline: Display "The Next Generation Test Drive: 3 Clicks to Experience Porsche."

CTA Button: A large MUI button with the secondary color (#CC0000). Text: "Start Your 3-Click Journey." On click, it should advance the context step to 1.

pages/ModelSelection.jsx (Step 1):

Title: "1/3. Find Your Ideal Porsche."

AI Interface: Simulate the AI chat using the data from aiConversation.js. Animate the appearance of questions and the final recommendation.

Model Display: Once the AI "recommends" a model, display it prominently using an MUI Card with the car's image, name, and title.

Buttons:

"Select This Model": An MUI button with the secondary color. On click, update the selectedModel in the context and advance the step to 2.

"Explore All Models": A secondary text link.

pages/BookingDetails.jsx (Step 2):

Title: "2/3. Select Your Experience."

Tabs: Use MUI Tabs for "Centre Test Drive" and "Concierge Service".

Centre Test Drive View:

An MUI Select dropdown populated with data from centers.js.

MUI DatePicker and TimePicker components from @mui/x-date-pickers.

Concierge Service View:

An MUI TextField for the delivery address.

DatePicker and TimePicker components.

A distinct info box (e.g., using MUI Alert with severity="info") explaining the refundable deposit.

CTA Button: "Confirm & Proceed". On click, save the details to the context and advance the step to 3.

pages/VerificationPayment.jsx (Step 3):

Title: "3/3. Confirm & Connect."

Porsche ID: A simple form with TextFields for email and password (no validation needed).

Payment Form:

This form should only be visible if bookingType in the context is 'concierge'.

Include TextFields for Card Number, Expiry Date, and CVC.

CTA Button: "Confirm Booking". On click, advance the step to 4.

pages/Confirmation.jsx (Step 4):

Title: "Congratulations. Your Test Drive is Confirmed."

Wallet Pass: An MUI Button with an icon for "Add to Wallet".

Experience Section: Use Cards or styled sections for:

AR/VR Preview: A button that opens a placeholder modal (MUI Modal) explaining the feature.

Engine Haptics: A button that simulates haptics (use window.navigator.vibrate(200); if on a supported device) and opens a modal to select "Drive Modes".

Test Drive Profile Section:

UI elements to "Select Your Theme/Route" (e.g., a dropdown).

Buttons with icons that link to Spotify and Apple Music.

Phase 5: Animation & Final Polish
Page Transitions: Wrap the page switching logic in App.jsx with Framer Motion's <AnimatePresence> component. Apply a simple fade or slide transition to each page component.

Micro-interactions: Use the whileHover and whileTap props from Framer Motion on all buttons and interactive cards to provide visual feedback (e.g., scale: 1.05).

Staggered Animations: When displaying lists of items (like the AI conversation), use staggerChildren in Framer Motion to animate them in one by one.
